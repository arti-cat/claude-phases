# Integration & Testing Phase

Test the cognitive assessment accuracy against real coding sessions and validate the complete system integration with Claude Code's statusline.

## Objectives

1. **System Integration Testing**
   - Test complete Claude Code statusline integration
   - Validate JSON data flow from Claude Code to cognitive analysis
   - Verify statusline display and responsiveness
   - Test configuration loading and theme switching

2. **Cognitive Accuracy Validation**
   - Test cognitive state detection against known behavioral patterns
   - Validate focus state accuracy with timed coding sessions
   - Test energy level assessment with productivity metrics
   - Verify context switching detection with directory changes

3. **ADHD Pattern Testing**
   - Test hyperfocus detection with extended sessions
   - Validate energy crash detection algorithms
   - Test context switching patterns for ADHD vs. neurotypical patterns
   - Verify break recommendation timing and effectiveness

4. **Performance and Reliability Testing**
   - Test statusline execution speed and responsiveness
   - Validate error handling and graceful degradation
   - Test configuration edge cases and validation
   - Verify system stability over extended use

## Testing Categories

### Integration Tests
