# Research & Analysis Phase

Execute comprehensive research on cognitive indicators available in Claude Code's statusline system and design behavioral pattern detection algorithms for ADHD-specific patterns.

## Objectives

1. **Fetch Claude Code Statusline Documentation**
   - Use Context7 to get current statusline JSON structure
   - Document available data fields and their meanings
   - Understand integration points and configuration options

2. **Map JSON Data to Cognitive States**
   - Analyze duration patterns for focus state detection
   - Map lines added/removed to productivity velocity
   - Correlate cwd changes with context-switching behavior
   - Design threshold algorithms for state transitions

3. **Research ADHD Behavioral Patterns**
   - Document hyperfocus vs. scattered attention patterns
   - Design energy level assessment algorithms
   - Create context-switching detection logic
   - Research break recommendations and timing

4. **Design Detection Algorithms**
   - Focus state: Based on session duration and consistency
   - Energy level: Using productivity velocity metrics
   - Context switching: Directory/project change frequency
   - Hyperfocus warning: Extended session detection

## Expected Deliverables

- Complete statusline JSON structure documentation
- Cognitive state mapping algorithms
- ADHD-specific behavioral pattern analysis
- Detection algorithm specifications with thresholds

Use Context7 extensively to ensure current and accurate documentation.
