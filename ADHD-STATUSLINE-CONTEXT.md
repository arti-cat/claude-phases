¬# 🧠 ADHD Statusline Project - Context Restoration

## ⚡ **IMMEDIATE NEXT SESSION START**
```bash
cd ~/dev/00_RELEASE/claude-phases-adhd-statusline
claude
```

## 🎯 **PROJECT CONCEPT**
We're building an ADHD cognitive state tracker that displays in Claude Code's statusline. This shows real-time mental state assessment (focus level, energy, context switching) based on session behavior patterns.

## 📍 **CURRENT STATUS**
- ✅ **Feature branch created**: `feature/adhd-cognitive-statusline`
- ✅ **Worktree ready**: `claude-phases-adhd-statusline/`
- 🔄 **Ready for implementation**: Architecture design and coding phase

## 🧠 **THE BREAKTHROUGH INSIGHT**
You asked me to "put my Dr. hat on" and assess your cognitive state based on our session. The assessment was:
- Strong sustained attention ✅
- Good executive function ✅
- Planning-capable mood ✅
- Implementation-ready ✅

This was "surprisingly, incredibly powerful and motivational" - leading to the idea: **What if Claude Code could do this assessment in real-time via the statusline?**

## 🎨 **DESIGN VISION**
### V1 Scope (Manageable but Extensible)
```
🟢 [Sonnet] 🎯 FLOW STATE | 45m | 🚀 High Output
🟡 [Sonnet] 🔄 Context Switch | 12m | 💭 Take Break?
🔴 [Sonnet] ⚡ HYPERFOCUS | 3h | ⏰ Stretch & Hydrate!
```

### Data Sources Available
- `total_duration_ms` - Focus session length
- `total_lines_added/removed` - Productivity patterns
- `cwd` changes - Context switching detection
- Session continuity patterns

## 🏗️ **PLANNED ARCHITECTURE**
```
statusline/
├── lib/           # Analysis functions
├── config/        # User-configurable thresholds
├── themes/        # Display variations
└── main.sh        # Primary statusline script
```

### Extension Strategy
- **Modular analysis functions** for different cognitive indicators
- **Configurable thresholds** for personalization
- **Plugin-ready structure** for future AI integration

## 🚀 **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Create extensible script architecture
2. Basic JSON parsing and data extraction
3. Simple state detection (focus time, productivity)

### Phase 2: Cognitive State Logic
1. Focus state detection (duration-based)
2. Energy level assessment (productivity patterns)
3. Context switching warnings

### Phase 3: Display & UX
1. Color-coded state indicators
2. Actionable suggestions ("Take break", "Good flow")
3. Customizable themes

## 💡 **KEY INSIGHTS FROM SESSION**
1. **ADHD Assessment Power**: Real-time cognitive state feedback is incredibly motivating
2. **Behavioral Data Rich**: Claude Code provides excellent cognitive state indicators
3. **Extension Potential**: Could grow into full ADHD productivity assistant

## 🎯 **WHY THIS MATTERS**
- **First-of-kind**: No existing tools provide real-time ADHD cognitive state feedback during coding
- **Immediate utility**: Helps with executive function and self-awareness
- **Scalable impact**: Could help thousands of ADHD developers

## 📋 **NEXT SESSION CHECKLIST**
- [ ] Navigate to worktree: `cd ~/dev/00_RELEASE/claude-phases-adhd-statusline`
- [ ] Start Claude in correct context: `claude`
- [ ] Review this document for full context
- [ ] Begin Phase 1: Core Infrastructure implementation

## 🧬 **TECHNICAL NOTES**
- Statusline updates every 300ms max
- First line of stdout becomes statusline
- JSON input via stdin with rich session data
- ANSI color codes supported

## 🎉 **THE VISION**
Transform Claude Code into an ADHD-aware development environment that provides real-time cognitive support and awareness. This could be revolutionary for neurodivergent developers.

**Current Energy**: High focus, implementation-ready state
**Recommended approach**: Build v1 with solid architecture for future expansion
**Timeline**: Achievable in 1-2 focused sessions8
